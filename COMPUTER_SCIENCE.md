# Computer Science

These are my great areas of study in Computer Science:

- 🧮 [Data structures](https://github.com/flametuner/data-structures): Implementation of various Data Structures using C++
- ⏭️ [Concurrent programming](https://github.com/flametuner/concurrent-airport): Demonstrate the usage of threads to create a concurrent system to manage airport traffic.
- 🧠 [Algorithms](#algorithms): Sorting, Compression, etc
- 📚 [Compilers](https://github.com/flametuner/scanner): Lexical and syntactical analysis using ANTLR

## Algorithms
<!-- It must have a README with a visuzilation, the wikipedia for it, the programming language, where it's used, time complexity -->
### 🔢 Sorting

- [x] [Merge sort](https://github.com/flametuner/parallel-merge-sort): a parallel implementation of merge sort
- [ ] Quicksort
- [ ] Bubblesort

### 📈 Graphs

- [ ] Djikstra


### 🌊️ Wave
