# Computer Science

These are my great areas of study in Computer Science:

- 🧮 [Data structures](https://github.com/flametuner/data-structures): Implementation of various Data Structures using C++
- ⏭️ [Concurrent programming](https://github.com/flametuner/concurrent-airport): Demonstrate the usage of threads to create a concurrent system to manage airport traffic.
- 🧠 [Algorithms](#algorithms): Sorting, Compression, etc
- [Compilers](#compilers): 

## Algorithms

### Sorting

- []
Djikstra, Quicksort, FFT <!-- It must have a README with a visuzilation, the wikipedia for it, the programming language, where it's used, time complexity -->
